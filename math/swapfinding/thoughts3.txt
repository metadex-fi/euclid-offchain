this is after rolling back the failed single jumpsize/exp experiment

we learned a new apprach, which is that we can avoid rounding-errors by using multiples of certain reduced values as the deltas. In particular:

- given the value equation: delta_b * a_s * (j_s + 1)**e_s * (j_b + 1)**e_b = delta_s * a_b * j_b**e_b * j_s**e_s
- we can, when calculating one delta given the other, avoid rounding-errors by setting the deltas to multiples of the numerator/denominator of the reduced fraction
  of the other stuff that results when rearranging above equation
- this unfortunately still requires choosing exponents first

next approach:

- exhaustive search over the four decision variables (exponents and deltas), discarding the ones that violate the 
  constraints and noticing the optimal ones 
- using this as ground truth, try to find patterns/optimizations and confirm them empirically

sample patterns:
- given a pair of exponents, we can calculate the spot price, which serves as a lower bound on effective price 
  - further we can think about how we could, given a pair of exps and thus spot price, find deltas that match this exactly
    - see the method of looking only at multiples of reduced numerator/denominator in the value equation

- to improve upon the former, we could 
  1. determine the exponents for the minDeltas
  2. see what spot price that would result in 
  3. for the given spot price, try to find a perfect pair of deltas using the method of reduction and upper bounds on
      the deltas for the given exp
  4. if we can't find one:
    a. try to find the best imperfect solution for the given exp-pair
    b. try increasing each exponent individually and iterate respectively (starting with the one resulting in the smaller spot price)

- we can try to confirm certain areas of monotonicity
