# Purpose

Splitting some functionalities into a separate repo which purely works with Deno. Splitting, as we are at this point still comitted to using the popular next.js-stack; if we wanted to be contrarians we would use Purescript. Lucid however uses Deno and it is an enjoyable experience, so that's what we are aiming to replicate here.
